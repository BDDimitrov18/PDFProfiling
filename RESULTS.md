# Boundary / Rotation Eval Results

Eval set: `eval_dev/` (9 files, ~181 pages, derived from `tests/` only) — unchanged across all
boundary runs (boundary truth from PDFsam split files; identical `ground_truth.json`).
Rotation truth from split PDFs' `/Rotate` metadata (CW→CCW); see Stage 1 log.
Model: Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct, greedy decoding (deterministic per GPU model, NOT across GPU
architectures — only compare rows with the same `gpu`).

## Boundary detection

| Stage | gpu | tol=0 P | tol=0 R | tol=0 F1 | tol=1 P | tol=1 R | tol=1 F1 | docs exact | notes |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|----------|---------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| Baseline | RTX 5090 | 77.89% | 92.50% | 84.57% | 77.89% | 92.50% | 84.57% | 65/89 | TP=74 FP=21 FN=6. Over-splits (low P). 12 of 21 FP in file 163444215. tol=1==tol=0 → FPs not off-by-one. |
| Fix 1 (REVERTED) | RTX 5090 | 74.00% | 92.50% | 82.22% | 75.00% | 93.75% | 83.33% | 63/89 | tol0 F1 −2.35 vs baseline (>2) → reverted. Added FPs (26 vs 21); worsened over-split on 163444215. |
| Fix R (kept) | RTX 5090 | 77.89% | 92.50% | 84.57% | 77.89% | 92.50% | 84.57% | 65/89 | Identical to baseline; 2 rotations applied but both boundary-irrelevant interior pages. No regression → kept. |
| Fix 4 | RTX 6000 Ada | running | | | | | | | de-anchor + cap noisy signals. NEW GPU — needs same-GPU baseline anchor before Stage B deltas are valid. |

**GPU comparability (per brief 2 / A4):** baseline, Fix 1, Fix R were measured on **RTX 5090**;
Fix 4 onward run on **RTX 6000 Ada** (pods cycled due to disk/OOM). Greedy decoding is
deterministic per GPU but not across architectures, so 5090 rows are NOT directly comparable
to 6000 Ada rows. Plan: after Fix 4 records, re-run the baseline on RTX 6000 Ada as a
same-hardware anchor; 5090 rows will then be struck through (kept for history).

## Rotation detection (degrees-exact, OSD arm)

| Stage | TP | FP | FN | wrong-deg | Precision | Recall | notes |
|-------|----|----|----|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Baseline (legacy VLM) | — | — | — | — | — | — | not run (optional; GPU). OSD arm chosen for Fix R. |
| OSD arm (truth=90 BUG) | 0 | 4 | 15 | 3 | 0% | 0% | truth used PDF /Rotate (CW) as CCW — wrong. |
| OSD arm (truth=270 fixed) | 3 | 1 | 12 | 0 | 75% | 20% | degree bug fixed; 1 FP = landscape low-text 180°. |
| OSD arm (thr 2.0→3.0) | 2 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 100% | 13.3% | FP abstained (truth still had bogus p7). |
| **OSD arm (truth from /Rotate)** | **2** | **0** | **12** | **0** | **100%** | **14.3%** | **GATE 1 PASS.** Rotation truth now from split /Rotate metadata (CW→CCW); p7 false positive removed. Fix R enabled. |

## Stage log

- **Stage 0** — harness built (`eval_boundaries.py`, `eval_rotation.py`, `test_osd_mapping.py`,
  `build_eval_set.py`). All compile clean. Edit targets for Stages 1-2 confirmed verbatim.
  eval_dev/ + eval_holdout/ generated. Baseline boundary F1=84.57%.
- **Stage 1** — 1a: `_OSD_TO_CCW` corrected to identity (synthetic test 12/12 pass).
  1b: `query_rotation_osd_first` added. 1c: `corroborate_aspect` quarantined (no call sites).
  Found+fixed a ground-truth bug (PDF /Rotate CW vs codebase CCW → 90 should be 270;
  visually confirmed). Raised abstention 2.0→3.0. **GATE 1 PASS (OSD precision 100%).**
